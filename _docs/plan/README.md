# /plan/ README

This folder contains step-by-step plans for setting up, slicing (feature-building), and releasing the project.

- **01-setup/**: Project bootstrapping, doc creation, scaffolding tasks.
- **02-slices/**: Each “slice” is a vertical feature. `00-slice-creation.md` defines them; `01-{slice}.md` implements them.
- **03-release/**: Final checklists and deployment docs.

To add a new plan file, ensure it follows the naming convention and references any relevant doc or slice.
