# o1 Prompting Guidelines
**Status**: [Draft / In Progress / Complete]

## Purpose
- Provide step-by-step guidance on writing effective prompts for the o1 AI model.

## Best Practices
1. **Context Pushing**  
   - [Give o1 all relevant docs or code snippets. Don’t rely on back-and-forth chat to gather context.]

2. **Focus on Output Format**  
   - [Be explicit about “Output a single markdown file labeled X.”]

3. **Use Clear Headers & Bullet Points**  
   - [Help the model structure its response to your needs.]

4. **One Deliverable Per Prompt**  
   - [Don’t request multiple distinct docs in a single prompt unless absolutely necessary.]

## Examples
- [Optional: Provide short example prompts with commentary.]

## Common Pitfalls
- [List mistakes like “not providing enough context,” “mixing multiple requests,” etc.]

## Next Steps
- [Remind readers to incorporate these guidelines into all doc creation or updates.]
